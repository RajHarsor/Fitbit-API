# Fitbit API
This tool is designed to access the Fitbit API using the command line. It is currently built for Project PACE.

 ## Installation

For non-technical people, there are quite a few steps but hopefully this guide will help.

### Step 1: Download Python
 If you don't have it already, you will need to download Python on your computer. You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Keep in mind that a lot of computers come with Python pre-installed (the Rowan ones), so you may not need to download it.

 ### Step 2: Download or Clone the Repository
 The repository is pretty much what will be used in order to access the Fitbit API. You can download the repository by clicking the green "Code" button and then clicking "Download ZIP". 

 If you are familiar with Git and have Git installed on your computer, you can clone the repository by running the following command in your terminal:
 
 ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RajHarsor/Fitbit-API.git
```
After getting the zip file, you will need to extract the files from the zip file. You can do this by right-clicking the zip file and clicking "Extract All".

### Step 3: Install the Required Libraries
In order to use the Fitbit API, you will need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running the following command in your command prompt:

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
